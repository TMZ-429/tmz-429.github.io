Grows too I guess


An individual nucleotide is made of a pentose sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base.
Multiple nucleotides strung together make up a strand of DNA or RNA.
Bond points are 3 & 5 on the pentose sugar.
The top of the strand's 5th point will be a phosphate.
The bottom of the strand's 3rd point will be a hydroxide.
This is 5-prime & 3-prime.

Nitrogenous bases connect together through hydrogen bonds.
Adenosines connect to Thymines & Guanines connect to Cytosines.

CG is 3 hydrogen bonds.
AT is 2 hydrogen bonds.

How DNA replciates itself:

One theory poses that it just sorta copies itself.
But this is wrong because kill yourself

Another theory poses that it breaks itself apart & reforms like bones, while the broken off parts reform into another strand of DNA.
This is also wrong because hang yourself


What happens is the strand is separated into its two strands.
Then, a new strand is made by having several points which are then segments of nucleotides.
These individual segments all work at the same time to build forward in the same direction.
Imagine you had to build an array of 2048 components.
Instead of going: for (int i = 0; i < 2048; i++, array[i] = whatever), which would be building the array one at a time forward.
You instead section off the 2048 array into 128 byte intervals and have threads concurrently build forward 128 bytes.

This process is called replication bubble theory of semi-conservative DNA replication.
