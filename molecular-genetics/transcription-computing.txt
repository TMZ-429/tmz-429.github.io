The process of transcription is very analogous to the process of collecting a file from a hard drive or a variable from RAM.
The promoter is equivalent to the starting address of the file content.
Then, the sequence of nitrogenous bases is very analogous to the binary sequence on the hard drive that represents bytes on a hard drive.
The end of the sequence where the mRNA strand creates guanines until it twists itself off is effectively the same as a mechanism that tells a computer that this is the end of the memory address and to stop going, lest it bleed into another locus or bleed into another memory address.
