Replication Forks

In a replication fork, chromatin is still wound up, it doesn't look like a forked path necessarily.
Two enzymes help unwind the chromatin:
-Gyrase softens the chromatin to help unwind it
 -Also called Topoisomerase
-Helicase 'unzips' or directly unwinds the chromatin

When helicase 'unzips' the DNA strands, it separates the nitrogenous bases on each strand from each other.

SSBPs are stuck to the ends of nitrogenous bases to stop them from trying to bind with each other
SSBP = Single Strand Binding Proteins

Loop:
While helicase keeps going, it eventually reaches a point where Primase is put into use.
Primase lays an RNA Primer on the 3-Prime end of the target strand, letting DNA Polymerase 3 know to start from there.
DNA Polymerase 3 (DNAP3)
-Hooks onto a 3-prime end and starts reading the strand while moving towards 5-prime.
-In doing so, it also builds the corresponding strand.

DNA Polymerase 1 will replace RNA Primers with appropriate DNA.

DNA Polymerase 2 will come in and audit the DNA strand to make sure there aren't mutations.
Adenine & Guanine (The purines) are the most likely to mess up.
If there are too many mutations, it breaks down the under-construction strands and re-coils the DNA - forcing a restart.
The loop is repeated as helicase keeps going on, creating the concurrent construction job from the bubble theory.
