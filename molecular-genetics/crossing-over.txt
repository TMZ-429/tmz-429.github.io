Crossing over occurs during prometaphase I in meosis.

Sometimes if unequal parts are exchanged during crossing over, it can cause childhood leukemia if the one with the larger piece is taken.
This is because the larger one tends to survive and the smaller one tends to die off.
This is called translocation.

Sometimes chromatids in a chromosome will twist together, sort of like testicular torsion.
When it unravels, the chromosome effectively crosses over with itself.
This is called an inversion mutation.
This can cause:
Cri-du-chat, which causes people to make a meowing-like crying sound and die at like 3-5 years old.
Hunter syndrome, which causes death at age 10-15.
