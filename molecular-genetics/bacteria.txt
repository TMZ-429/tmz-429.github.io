Bacteria don't have a nucleus, they just have a single circular chromosome.

Because of this, an RNA Polymerase just sort of comes in and starts making protiens.
As a result, they can translate proteins very quickly.
But, to regulate this, they have on/off switches.

There's a bacteria in the human body that has a promote & operator region in its plasmid.
They also have 3 lactase regions, which take the glucose from lactose and return the galactose.

They have a repressor which is placed in the operator and blocks its usage until lactose enters.
Allolactose fits into the repressor, which sort of acts like a competitive inhibitor, changes the shape of the operator so that it can't be blocked, allowing lactose to be broken down.
This system is called an induced fit -- something is induced into the unit and changes how it fits.

Another bacteria has a promoter, repressor and 5 tryptophan sequences.
Its repressor fits tryptophan, meaning that if there's too much tryptophan being used, it just shuts itself down until it's needed again.

Repressors effectively block important DNA sequences in the gene required to build a certain protein (Such as the promoter)
Think of it like a lock with an allosteric site to lock it that takes in the protein it's meant to regulate.
