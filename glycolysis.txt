For some reason we have to remember LEO_GER:
Lose Electron Oxidation, Gain Electron Reduction

Glycolysis
Glycolysis starts any energy expenditure in a cell.
Carrier molecules (Namely, NAD+) capture electrons to use as energy for this process.
4 Electrons are required, and the NAD+'s gather a hydrogen each.
Therefore, to gather the two electrons, 2NADH's are made.

The next part of this process is referred to as 'substrate level phosphorilation'
The glucose is captured and by the enzyme 'hexokinase' and phosphoralized by it -- using dehydration synthesis to bond a phosphate to the 6th carbon, turning into glucose-6-phosphate.
The phosphate used for the phosphoralization is from hydrolysized ATP.
The glucose-6-phosphate is then isomerized into fructose-6-phosphate due to phosphoglucose isomerase (Another enzyme)
Another phosphate group is bound to fructose, turning it into fructose 1-6 biphosphate by PFK (Phosphofructokinase).
The same ATP does not give its two phosphates to the glucose & fructose -- only ATP is going to be giving its phosphates.

The 6 carbon glucose is broken down into 2 3-carbon molecules called 'pyruvate'.
