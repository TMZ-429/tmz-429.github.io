Cellular Respiration
C6H12O6 + 6(O2) -> 6(CO2) + 6(H2O)
^ This can be glucose, fructose or galactose -- we are able to process all 3.
For the sake of this note, we will focus on glucose.

Nutrients can actually be processed by cells to produce energy without the mitochondrial.

Glycolosis
Glucose start in the cytoplasm.
Carrier molecules (Namely, NAD & FAD2+) capture electrons to use as energy for this process.
The 6 carbon glucose is broken down into 2 3-carbon micromolecules called 'pyruvate'.

Pyruvate Oxidation
The pyruvate needs to enter the mitochondria, so they get oxidized into acetyl attached to Coenzyme A.
This is considered an "Acetyl CoA" instead.
Carbon dioxide is removed from the pyruvates as part of the oxidation reaction (A carboxyl is removed from it)
The Acetyl CoA is taken to into the mitochondria, where the acetyl will be used as fuel for the citric acid cycle.

Electron Transport Chain
Carrier molecules (3NADH, FAD(H2)) take electrons to the interior of the mitochondria
As electrons exist in the mitochondria, they find oxygen molecules & hydrogen atoms, therefore producing water.
