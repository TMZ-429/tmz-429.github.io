PFK
Phosphofructokinase is inhibited by an abudndance of ATP.
So if there's too much ATP in the cell, PFK is shut down.
When ATP starts getting used, phosphofructokinase is starting to be activated.

Hexokinase
Hexokinase is inhibited by an abundance of NADh.
If there's too much NADH, it just shuts down.
This is the reason lactic acid fermentation occurs if ATP stores are low or 0.

A high concentration of NADH means the Electron Transport Chain is backed up.
NADH abundance also inhibits citrate synthase which in turn increases Acetyl CoA, as it's not being further processed.

Each cell has a threshold of ATP.
When supplies are low (Meaning ADP levels are high), then hexokinase & phosphofructokinase are activated.
