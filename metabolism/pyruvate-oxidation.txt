The pyruvate oxidation procedure is meant to alter pyruvate into a state where it's usable for the citric acid cycle of cellular respiration.

Pyruvate oxidation:
For each pyruvate:
The pyruvate enters the mitochondria through an integral protein leading to the matrix.
The two oxygens & carbon on the top of the pyruvate (C(=O)-O) are oxidized off of the pyruvate, resulting in CO2.
The pyruvate is then bound to pyruvate dehydrogenase.
The hydroxyethyl group from the pyruvate is oxidized into an acetyl group.
NAD+ becomes NADH by collecting electrons from the previous reaction and also binding with the hydrogens littered throughout the lumen.
An acetyl group is then transferred to Coenzyme A, turning the pyruvate into pyruvate CoA.

When oxidized, acetyl CoA delivers its acetyl group to the four-carbon molecule oxolacetate, forming citrate.
The citrate is used as fuel for the citric acid cycle.
