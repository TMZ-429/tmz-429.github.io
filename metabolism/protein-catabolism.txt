Lipid Metabolism:
Breaking lipids down into nutrients

A triglyceride is broken down into a glycerol + fatty acid
2 glycerol can be converted into a glucose called gluconeogenesis (Evangelion)
The gluconeogensis has a bit too many hydrogens, though (16 to be specific)
A fatty acid enters the mitochondrial matrix via beta oxidation.
The process removes 2 carbons at a time and combines with Coenzyme A to become Acetyl CoA, which is used in the krebs cycle.
It's easier to process saturated fatty acids than unsaturated fatty acids and especially trans unsaturated fatty acids.

Protein catabolism:
Protein catabolism is the absorption of protein as nutrients to fuel cellular respiration.
Deamination
The amino group is removed and converted to ammonia in the liver and removed via the urinary tract.
The remaining who carbon molecules enter the krebs cycle, with the support of Coenzyme A.
