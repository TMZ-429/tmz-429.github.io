Photosynthesis big picture:
Carried out by plants, algae, protists, cynobacteria
(Carried out by anything with a chloroplast/chlorophyll)
Electrons in a porphyrin ring of chlorophyll absorb light energy.
The overall process is broken down into 3 distinct phases:
1: Capturing light energy (The light reaction)
2: Creating NADPH and ATP
3: Using 'energy' to fix CO2 into organic compounds (Binding with hydrogen)

The Calvin Cycle effectively takes CO2 input and turns it into CH2O.
The Light reactions take water in and turn it into oxygen output.
NADP+ from the Calvin Cycle is given to the thylakoids in the light reactions, along with ADP.
The light reactions convert it to NADPH & ATP to give into the Calvin Cycle.

Plants don't necessarily make glucose -- they'd prefer to make fructose in actuality.

Anatomy of the chloroplast:
Outer shell / membrane -> stroma
individual disk-shaped unit -> thylakoid
stack of thylakoids -> granum
There are holes in chlorophyll pigments that are to be filled with electrons
"Wiring" connecting grana: lamellae

Inside of a thylakoid are reflective surfaces (sort of like mirrors) that take light rays & bounce them around to focus them into a focal 'P.E.A' point.
P.E.A = Primary Electron Acceptor.
Plants' electron transport chain is much more efficient than animals'.

Plants have two photosystems - P680 & P700.

The Chemiosomotic Gradient (Essentially the electron transport chain that occurs in the light cycle).
Sunlight enters PSII, which is used by the Z-Enzyme to split water into half an oxygen molecule & 2 hydrogen ions.
This produces 2 electrons & kicks oxygen out as a waste product.
The electron excited out of PSII are shuttled by the intrinsic protein PQ into the B6-F Complex.

The B6-F complex is an integral protein which takes hydrogen ions from outside of the lumen & places them inside of the lumen.
Then, it shuttles the electron through PC to PSI
PSI restimulates electrons with solar energy

The electron is then shuttled by Ferrodoxin (Fd) into NADP Reductase, which reduces NADP+ by combining it with hydrogen into NADPH.
NADP reductase actually has 2 electrons to give to NADPH.

Hydrogens can only leave through ATP Synthase -- they rush out of it 4 at a time, creating the energy to synthesize ADP with Inorganic Phosphate to create ATP.
Think of the hydrogens leaving ATP synthase like a proton waterfall & the light reaction cycle is sort of like a big hydroelectricity plant.
ATP synthase in plants needs 4 hydrogens coming out of it to make 1 ATP.
6 hydrogens are produced in total.
4 are needed for ATP synthase usage, the rest are used for Carbon Dioxide conversion & NADP reductase.
