Krebs Cycle
-Occurs within the matrix of the mitochondria
-Occurs when Acetyl CoA enters the matrix

Oxaloacetate.
looks kinda like C-C-C-C-C-C

Citrate synthase
-Is an enzyme
-Synthesizes oxaloacetate & acetyl CoA into citrate.

Citrate then reconfigures itself into isocitrate.
Isocitrate then loses a carbon & two oxygens, turning into alpha-ketogluterate.
Then NAD+ collects the newly freed electron.
Then, a-ketogluterate loses another CO2 and another Coenzyme A attaches to the free slot.
This turns it into Succinyl Coenzyme A.
Then, an inorganic phosphate displaces the new Coenzyme A.
A GDP then collects the inorganic phosphate from the Succinate, so that it can give the phosphate to ADP's to make ATP.

Succinate (4 carbon molecule w/ a double bond) then turns into fumarate by removing its own double bond.
More elctrons are freed, then FAD2+ enters and scoops the elctrons up to become FADH2.
Then, the fumarate becomes malate through water reforming it.
Then, malate becomes oxaloacetate, displacing electrons and causing NAD+ to pick them up and become NADH.

Per glucose, the krebs cycle produces:
2 ATP
6 NADH
2 FADH2
