Lactic Acid fermentation:
Glycolysis needs NAD+ to function
NADH has to be generated for glycolysis to continue
Lactate is a holding molecule until O2 can be retrieved and it can be converted back into pyruvate.
If O2 is not retrieved in time, lactate becomes lactic acid because there aren't enough NAD+'s to take the hydrogens around, and they bond to lactate.
Lactic acid like hurts and stuff.

This happens because the hydrogen from NADH is put in lactate and the NAD+ is used for glycolysis.
But, it causes an 'oxygen-debt' of course.

Ethanol fermentation
Happens for the same reason as lactic acid fermentation, in that there are too many NADH's and not enough NAD+'s.
The key difference is that a CO2 is removed from pyruvate with pyruvate decarboxylase, foirming acetylaldehyde.
Acetylaldehyde receives 2 electrons and 2 hydrogen ions from the cytosol to form ethanol.
2 ATP's are produced as long as carbohydrates are available.

Ethanal is ethanol minus a hydrogen.
