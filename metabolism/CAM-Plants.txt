CAM -> Crassalcean Acid Metabolism
Used by succulent plants, such as pineapple & cacti.

-Specific daily pattern triggered by photoreceptors on the guard cells.
-Stomata opens at night when the photoreceptors return negative.
-CO2 enters the stomata & is incorporated into a 4-carbon organic acid via PEP Carboxylase.
-The organic acid is stored in the large central vacuole
-During the day time, the organic acid is broken down to steadily release CO2 into the plant.
-Then, in the night, there's a very little concentration of CO2 within the plant and high concentration of O2, so the O2 rushes out and is immediately replaced by CO2.
