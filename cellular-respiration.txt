Cellular Respiration
C6H12O6 + 6(O2) -> 6(CO2) + 6(H2O)
^ This can be glucose, fructose or galactose -- we are able to process all 3.
For the sake of this note, we will focus on glucose.

Nutrients can actually be processed by cells to produce energy without the mitochondrial.

For some reason we have to remember LEO_GER:
Lose Electron Oxidation, Gain Electron Reduction

Glycolysis
Glycolysis starts any energy expenditure in a cell.
Carrier molecules (Namely, NAD+) capture electrons to use as energy for this process.
4 Electrons are required, and the NAD+'s gather a hydrogen each.
Therefore, to gather the two electrons, 2NADH's are made.

The next part of this process is referred to as 'substrate level phosphorilation'
The glucose is captured and by the enzyme 'hexokinase' and phosphoralized by it -- using dehydration synthesis to bond a phosphate to the 6th carbon, turning into glucose-6-phosphate.
The phosphate used for the phosphoralization is from hydrolysized ATP.
The glucose-6-phosphate is then isomerized into fructose-6-phosphate due to phosphoglucose isomerase (Another enzyme)
Another phosphate group is bound to fructose, turning it into fructose 1-6 biphosphate by PFK (Phosphofructokinase).
The same ATP does not give its two phosphates to the glucose & fructose -- only ATP is going to be giving its phosphates.

The 6 carbon glucose is broken down into 2 3-carbon molecules called 'pyruvate'.


Pyruvate Oxidation
The pyruvates needs to enter the mitochondria, so they get oxidized into acetyl attached to Coenzyme A.
This is considered an "Acetyl CoA".
Carbon dioxide is removed from the pyruvates as part of the oxidation reaction (A carboxyl is removed from it)
The Acetyl CoA is taken to into the mitochondria, where the acetyl will be used as fuel for the citric acid cycle.

Electron Transport Chain
Carrier molecules (3NADH, FAD(H2)) take electrons to the interior of the mitochondria
As electrons exist in the mitochondria, they find oxygen molecules & hydrogen atoms, therefore producing water.
