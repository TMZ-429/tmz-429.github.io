Antidiuretic Hormone [ADH] helps regulate osmotic pressure and body fluid volume.
Aldosterone regulates body fluid volume
ADH and Aldosterone work via negative feedback:
-Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus shrink when body fluid levels are low
-Hypothalamus shrinkage sends a signal to the pituitary gland
-Pituitary gland releases ADH
-ADH leads to the distal convoluted tubule [DCT] to increase uptake of any positive ion (Mostly metals)
-ADH also creates the thirst response in the brain
