Adrenal Gland:
-Located at the top of the kidneys
-Composed of 2 layers

Layer-Inner Medulla
-Short Term Stress:
	-Hypothalamus has a direct neural line to the adrenal gland
	-Causes the release of epinephrine/adrenaline
		-Increased heart-rate, increased breathing-rate
		-Increased blood pressure
		-Decreased blood flow to extremities
		-Increased liver function
		-Pupils dilate, other senses are dulled

Layer Outer Cortex
-Hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary gland to release ACTH
-Causes Adrenal Gland to release:
	-Cortisol:
		-Increased blood sugar
		-Decreased inflammation
		-Decreased immune system response
	-Aldosterone:
		-Increased sodium absorption at DCT
		-Increased blood pressure
		-Feel bloated
-Concerns with constant adrenaline:
	-Blood sugar levels are consistently heightened to the point of adult early onset diabetes
	-Blood pressure is too high, causes strokes
	-Heart rate is too high, causes heart attacks
