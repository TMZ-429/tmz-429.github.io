LSD is created synthetically from ergot (A fungus found on rye)
Similar in nature to magic mushrooms, DMT, etc.

Synthetic creation causes it to be more potent in low concentrations.

Intake: Injestion or injection

How it works:
Binds to serotonin and dopamine receptors, as a partial agonist and acts partially like serotonin (Not as strong, though)
Has a very high binding affinity, when compared to other psychadellics.
Has slightly different activation pathways to serotonin, causing other effects other than just feeling good.

LSD has very long effects on the system, even though its half-life is rather short.

Effects:
'Good trips':
Euphoria, 'spiritual connection', calmness, audio & video hallucionations.

Bad trips:
Confusion, anxiety, paranoia, psychosis-like symptoms.

Short term effects:
-Increased heart rate
-Increased blood pressure
-Increased breathing rates
-Increased body temperature
(Due to serotonin-receptor-effects)

Long term effects:
-Loss of sleep
-Loss of appetite

Addiction:
-LSD is far lesss addictive than other drugs
-Doesn't cause compulsive drug seeking behaviour
-Doesn't act on the brain's reward system like other drugs

Withdrawal:
-Doesn't create withdrawal
-But, anxiety, depression, confusion and psychosis can develop.
-Previously treated mental health issues can return

Long term effects:
-Flashbacks to previous trips
-'Visual snow'
-LSD can trigger serotonin syndrome, which causes the body to produce more serotonin due to a perceived lack of it.
