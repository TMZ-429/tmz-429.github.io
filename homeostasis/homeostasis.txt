Homeostasis is a process by which a constant operational internal environment is maintained in the body.
Things within the body have to be maintained in order to adapt for the outside environment.

Most homeostatic mechanisms work on a negative feedback loop because they need some form of resource (Normally ATP) to burn through.
Most systems only need to work if pre-set conditions are not being kept.

All homeostatic mechanisms require three functional components:
1. A monitor to sense if change is happening
2. Coordinating center, which uses the monitor to put regulators in action.
3. Regulator, which uses organs, hormones and chemicals to effect various parts to return the body to the pre-set condition

Most elder diseases happen because the regulator is worn out to the point where it gives up.

Thermoregulation in the human body:

Bodily cooling steps:

1. Blood vessels dilating or expanding, allowing for more blood flow
2. Muscle expansion
3. Sweat

Basically: Surface area expansion

Bodily warming steps:
1. Nasal constriction, restricting blood flow to the major organs of the body
2. Muscle constricting
3. Muscle spasming causing heat
4. Hair standing up, in an attempt to create a layer of warmth
5. Mouth breathing stops so that heat is trapped in the mouth

Basically: Surface area constriction

The monitor of thermoregulation is the blood, as water is the best regulator / monitor of temperature
The regulator is the hypothalamus
