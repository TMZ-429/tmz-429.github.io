Structure:
>What heroin looks like
>What is an opioid?
>How heroin disperses into the system:
	>Heroin -> 6-MAM
	>6-MAM -> Morphine
>Why do heroin or 6-MAM instead of directly injecting morphine?
	>(Answer is because it crosses blood brain barrier)
>G-Proteins
>Mu-opioid receptors
	Mu are where 90% of the activity comes from so kind of graze over the Kappa & Delta receptors
	Diagrams
>AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE AFFECTED
>Effects on homeostasis:
	Desireable (Pain relief for medical, euphoria for recreational)
	Undesierable (Reward response, slowness of bodily function, toxic effects of the heart because it slows the heart muscles)
>Effects on the body (Necrosis)
>Effects of addiction
	>Increased resistence -- South Park dragon chasing clip
	>Withdrawal
>Different forms of heroin (Black tar heroin & krokodil)
