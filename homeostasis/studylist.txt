>G-Proteins & Mu opioid receptor (How opioid directly inhibits pain with calcium)
>How fentanyl still retains its structure

Structure:
>G-Proteins
>Mu-opioid receptors
	Mu are where 90% of the activity comes from so kind of graze over the Kappa & Delta receptors
>Diagrams
>Effects on homeostasis:
	Desireable (Pain relief for medical, euphoria for recreational)
	Undesierable (Reward response, slowness of bodily function, toxic effects of the heart because it slows the heart muscles)
