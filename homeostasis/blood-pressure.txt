Low blood pressure can be caused by;
Being cut
Dehydration
Internal bleeding

Blood pressure is checked every second by an aparatus in the bowman's capsule, called the juxtaglomerular apparatus or JGA.
It measures blood pressure as filtrate is coming into the bowman's capsule.
When blood pressure is low, the hormone Renin is placed into the blood.
When Renin & Angiotensinogen (Naturally produced substance in the body with no purpose) synthesize, the result is angiotensin.

Angiotensin causes blood vessels to constrict, as that increases blood pressure.
It also causes aldosterone to be released from the adrenal glands and enter the nephron and increase sodium active transport, to increase the volume of water exiting the nephron.
This step can also cause blood pressure to go too high, which can causes issues.
Aldersterone can also be considered the 'stress drug', as it's released when the body is stressed.
