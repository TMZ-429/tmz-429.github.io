6-MonoAcetylMorphine or 6-MAM is an opioid and a metabolite of heroin.
An opioid is a group of medicines that can be natural, synthetic or semi-synthetic that are similar to or derived from the drug opium, which is found in the poppy flower.
That are defined by their ability to enter the bloodstream and cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the brain and interact with 'opium receptors' in the brain.

Opium receptors usually interact with other molecules to create neurological responses to pain or the regulation of breathing.
Opium and opioids hijack these opium receptors to change what the brain is doing.

A common example of this is the pain-killing effect of opium:
Opium blocking molecules related to pain responses by being in the opium receptor, then activating the opium receptor to send a pain relieving signal.

What is a metabolite:
A metabolite is a substance produced by a metabolic process.

An important example of a metabolite is the substance produced after the metabolism of a drug.

What is 6-MAM:
>Has short half life (5-15 minutes depending on metabolism)
>Crosses blood brain barrier better than morphine because it's fat soluble
>Fentanyl is the most fat soluble, making it the most potent

>Heroin diffuses very fast throughout the entire body via the bloodstream, causing very fast effects all over the body instantly.

>Mu opioid receptors are all over the body, including the spine, brain and GI tract.

Undesired effect of heroin:

>Slows down brain activity and therefore causes bodily slowing, including respiratory rate lowering
>Eventually causes agonal breathing, sounds like snoring and due to the lack of oxygen in the brain, they die
>'Foam cone'

>Naloxone binds to opioid receptors like a non-competitive inhibitor to heroin but is slightly competitive to the normal molecules

6-MAM is a metabolite of heroin, meaning it is the result of heroin being metabolized -- specifically, first pass metabolism.
It's then metabolized again and the resulting metabolite is morphine.
This morphine is what triggers the high in users, as it's an opiate (Natural substance derived from opium)

Enkophalins: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557764/

Beta Endorphins:

Dynorphins:

Opioid receptors:

There are three kinds of opioid receptors:

Mu:
The mu receptor is the most potent, as agonists that target it are the most addictive and powerful.
Morphine is an agonist that targets the mu receptors, meaning that 90% of the effects of morphine are due to it binding to mu receptors
(Agonist = chemicals that targets a homeostatic receptor)
They have the highest affinity for enkophalins and beta-endorphin, but a low affinity for dynorphins

Enkaphephalins:
-Bind to opioid receptors to cause pain relieving

Beta Endorphin:
-Regulate pain

Kappa
-Important for analgesia (Loss of pain)

Delta
-Regulate causes of persistent or chronic pain

Question I had but had them answered:
Heroine metabolizes into 6-MAM and then finally into morphine:
Is this how opioids and opiates are able to cause the same effect despite having different structures? Do they just get reformed during metabolism into morphine?
Is this similar to how fructose, glucose and galactose are all formed into 2 pyruvate during cellular respiration.

Answer:
All opioids are metabolized, then their metabolites are metabolized, then those metabolites are metabolized and so on and so forth until the resultant morphine is created.
This is a very similar process to how fructose, glucose and galactose are metabolized until they turn into fructose biphosphate, which is then turned into pyruvate for usage in the body.
