Glycosidic bonds are covalent bonds that join a saccharide (carbohydrate) with another organic compound.
The two carbohydrates are linked with a single oxygen atom, which can be seen much clearer in a diagram of the molecule.
An example of this is lactose, which is glucose and galactose bound together by an oxygen atom.

They are catalyzed by appropriate enzymes (Depending on the groups interacting with each other).

Glycosidic bonds are broken when water is added in a 'hydrolysis' reaction.
A hydrolysis reaction is when water breaks something down.
To create a glycosidic bond, water is created in a 'condensation' reaction.
The exact formation of this is due to a hydroxide, followed by a hydrogen being removed from the structure of the molecules.
