Diffusion:
Solutions want to have an equal concentration across their entire area.
If you had a cell with 4 solutes in it, but the outside has 3 solutes, the outside would have a lower concentration than the inside.
Therefore, to lower that concentration, solutes would exit the cell and vice-versa if it was a lower concentration in the cell.

Simple vs facilitated.
Simple diffusion is small molecules simply diffusing in & out of for example a cell membrane.
In a cell, due to the phospholipid bilayer, nonpolar and small molecules can get through via simple diffusion.

Facilitated diffusion:
Facilitated diffusion requires openings in the cell membrane to achieve.
It allows large molecules, polar molecules and ions to enter.
This is achieved through structures such as aquapores and integral proteins.

Osmosis:
Osmosis is the movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane.
Essentially, if there are two solutions of differing concentrations, the water itself will move from the low concentration to the high concentration.
Or in other words, water moves from high concentration of water to low concentration of water.

If a cell is in a hypotonic solution (I.E: Water around is at a higher concentration), the cell will balloon or 'blow up' from water entering it.
If a cell is in a hypertonic solution, the cell will shrivel and give water to the surroundings.


Hypotonic surrounding = hypertonic cell
Hypertonic surrounding = hypotonic cell

[Hypo,hyper,iso]-tonic:
Hypo  = low
Hyper = high
iso   = same
tonic = concentration
