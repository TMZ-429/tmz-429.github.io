A functional group is a group of atoms that when covalently bound to another molecule will influence its characteristics (I.E: Influence what sort of chemical reactions it may have.)
As a result of this, certain attributes of a compound can be predicted simply because of the functional group it belongs to.

Functional groups:
hydroxyl: -OH
carbonyl: =O
carboxyl: −C(=O)−OH
amino   : -NH2
methyl  : -CH3
amide	: -(=O)-NH2
