Nucleic acids include:
Information/"machine code":
DNA
RNA

Energy:
-ATP
-ADP
-GTP
-GDP

Nucleic acids have a basic structure called a nucleotide.
The nucleotide has 3 components:
A phosphate
A pentose sugar
A Nitrogenous base

Two pentose sugars are:
Ribose sugar
Deoxyribose sugar

The phosphate group is bound to the pentose sugar by a dehydration bond.
This bond is called a phosphoester bond.
Phosphate groups bind to 2 pentose sugars, creating 2 phosphoester bonds, or a 'phosphodiester bond'.
The phosphate groups will bind 5-3, 5-3 to the pentose sugars until the last pentose sugar in the chain only has a carbon-5 bond and not a carbon-3 bond.

The carbon-1 hydroxyl group connects to a nitrogenous base.

(Adenine is important but work on that later)

Nitrogenous bases attract each other by hydrogen attractions.

In RNA, there's an extra hydroxyl group in the pentose sugars
and instead of Thymine there's Uracil.

Adenine & Guanine are purines.
This is because they have a 2-part structure.

Uracil, Cytosine & Thymine are pyramidines, because they're a 1 hexagon structure.

ATP
Adenosine Triphosphate

ATP is composed of Adenine, a pentose & 3 phosphates.
If one phosphate is removed it becomes ADP (Adenosine Diposphate)
